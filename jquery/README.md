# DevExtreme jQuery PieChart - Getting Started 

This repository stores the code examples of the jQuery PieChart component for the [Getting Started with PieChart](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/PieChart/Getting_Started_with_PieChart/) tutorial. The PieChart UI component visualizes data as a circle divided into portions (slices) to illustrate data proportions. This tutorial shows how to add a PieChart to the page and configure the component's core features.

## Development server

Run `npx http-server -c-1` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
